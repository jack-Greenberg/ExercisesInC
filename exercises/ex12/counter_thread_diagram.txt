The final value of the counter is correct

If I increase the number of children to 50, there are still synchronization issues. Even at the beginning, somehow I got the output:
    counter = 0
    counter = 1
    counter = 0
    counter = 0
    counter = 4
which is not correct. But they do seem to be running concurrently, just not synchronously.
